# Am I a writer?

This is how I'd like to start my first blog post. I don't have any particular reason for it but I've thought that it'd be an interesting idea to discuss.

I hated everything related to the general writing a while back cuz I was, I'm, I'll be bad at it. It kinda demotivates you to do it when whatever you write is bad, especially gramatticly bad. I believe you can encounter some of them throughout of this text as well.

The reality is that I'm writing this post rn and I'll publish it to the Internet and everybody can see it. It's wonderful, innit? Actually, I don't say the "innit" but I wanna get used to it cuz it is quicker to say it than the "ain't". Back to the topic, I've never thought that I'll actually write any text, blog posts, scripts... for fun. I am enjoying it cuz it helps me put my thoughts into words, and I can look through it and analyse it. It is very helpful th. I recall Mr.[Jordan B. Peterson](https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson) recommends it. I don't usually do it but when I do, I just dive in this writing world of mine which makes me happy. Hahahhaa... Happy? My younger self would despise me for such silly words.

So... Am I a writer? Do I see myself that I'd write more? I'll do anything but the first. I don't like the idea of becoming an author(title). I'm going back to pick up some Russian books by Mr. Doestoevskiy, Tolstoy... cuz it was taught in school which ofc, I haven't read it fully. I believe those books ain't quite for pupils. They are very realistic, dramatic and hard to read. They are the writers. Their work was, is and will be iconic among classic readers which I am not. I find their books very interesting rn.

I do Youtuve videos but this blog will serve a different purpose.
I'll publish more posts. They can be related to different topics. I guess it can my conclusion.
