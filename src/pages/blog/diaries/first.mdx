# What is this?

This is a post about a post about a post. I'm just testing out the new Jekyll theme I'm using for this blog. I'm using the [Just the Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#custom-components-with-imported-mdx) theme, which is a Jekyll theme for building documentation sites. It's built on top of the popular Jekyll theme [Minimal Mistakes]() and includes a number of enhancements and customizations.

## What's new?

I've added a few things to the theme:

- A new color scheme
- A new font
- A new code block style

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")
```
