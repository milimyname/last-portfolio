# Why haven't I written/posted anything yet?

It is actually hard to write anything on ur own cuz my lovely assistant (Copilot) tries to add
his own ideas to my text. I'm not sure if I like it or not. That's fine cuz I disabled rn for this files
where I write my posts.

I've been busy with exams, so I just postponed my side activities. It is one of my excuses but soon I'll do it.
Why do I even write this? I personally don't have any idea cuz it is 3 am and I could have gone to sleep at this time.
However, I want to finish with the home page of the project one and write more.

I was dealing with the [Threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) to show the 3d Texts but it doesn't have info enough to make it
as I want so. We will see it how it goes further but for now, I'm fine but it'd be better next time. I got more experience
with [React three fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) but I don't wanna use
React that often and combining Astro with Svelte comps was pretty cool up to the moment when I started working with 3d objects.
I guess I need to use another tools for better integration with it.

There are some issues which need to be updated or fixed in Astro. Hopefully, I'll fix it.
