# Let's build a C2C for Uzbek people?

I'm very excited to get started with this idea.

## TLDR:

Blogs, reviews, videos... by Uzbeks around the world for Uzbeks...
Here is my [YT link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iPNiZSiKZI) to it if u don't like reading it.

## Why do I wanna do it?

Let's keep it simple.

1. No info/lack of info.
2. Not fond of Facebook posts, TG/Whatsapp message. Can be better.
3. News related to an Uzbek community around the world.

Personal reasons:

1. Open source.
2. Contribution to an Uzbek community.
3. I CANNOT FIND ANY INFO FOR ME.

## Why do U wanna join it?

1. Kindness.
2. Wanna be a part of intersting project.
3. Provide ur services with the idea of helping more.
4. Look for more opportunities

## What?

I personally wanna see it more than just blogs and whatsoever.

Place where I can share, find and get info about anything related to Uzbek people around the world which
is lacking now. Kinda Discord Server + Web App + Newsletter.

## Issues

1. No Uzbek/Russian support.
2. Lack of Dev, Content... contributors
3. Open Source === no budget. Only from community to community.

## How?

It's open and will be discussed further with future core members and contributors.
